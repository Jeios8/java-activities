## Task Sheet 1-1-3  
**Combine Java Arithmetic Operators with the Assignment Operator**

This task involves modifying an existing Java program (`ArithmeticTask.java`) to use compound assignment operators. By completing this task, you will enhance your understanding of Java arithmetic operations, assignment operators, and their combined usage in simplifying code. You will also practice compiling and running Java programs using the Java Standard Edition specification.

### Key Skills Covered:
- Understanding and applying compound assignment operators in Java (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`).
- Editing and modifying existing Java source code.
- Compiling and running Java programs in an IDE or online environment.
- Following Java Standard Edition specifications.

## Task Sheet 1-1-4
**Writing Control Flow Statements Using Loops**

This task involves creating a Java program that utilizes control flow statements and loops to determine whether numbers are odd or even. By completing this task, you will practice using loops, conditional (ternary) operators, and string manipulation in Java while ensuring the program compiles and runs without errors in a Java virtual machine (JVM).

### Key Skills Covered:
- Writing and using loops in Java.
- Implementing conditional logic with the ternary operator.
- Manipulating and formatting strings.
- Compiling and running Java applications in an IDE or online environment.
