## Task Sheet 1-1-1
**Modify and compile a simple Java executable program**

This task focuses on debugging, editing, and compiling a simple Java program to meet specified objectives. You will learn to identify and fix syntax errors, modify the program's output message, and ensure it runs without errors using the Java Standard Edition specification. The exercise emphasizes the fundamentals of Java syntax, basic debugging, and running Java applications in an IDE or online environment.

### Key Skills Covered:
- Debugging syntax and runtime errors in Java.
- Editing source code to meet specific requirements.
- Compiling and running Java programs in an IDE or online environment.
- Adhering to Java Standard Edition specifications for application development.

# Task Sheet 1-1-2  
**Create and concatenate primitive data types in Java**

This task involves creating a Java program that declares various primitive data types (except `long` and `double`), assigns them values, and concatenates them into a formatted string for output. By completing this task, you will practice working with Java's primitive types, string manipulation, and the fundamentals of compiling and running Java applications.

### Key Skills Covered:
- Working with Java primitive data types.
- Concatenating values into a string.

## Task Sheet 1-1-3  
**Combine Java Arithmetic Operators with the Assignment Operator**

This task involves modifying an existing Java program (`ArithmeticTask.java`) to use compound assignment operators. By completing this task, you will enhance your understanding of Java arithmetic operations, assignment operators, and their combined usage in simplifying code. You will also practice compiling and running Java programs using the Java Standard Edition specification.

### Key Skills Covered:
- Understanding and applying compound assignment operators in Java (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`).
- Editing and modifying existing Java source code.
- Compiling and running Java programs in an IDE or online environment.
- Following Java Standard Edition specifications.
