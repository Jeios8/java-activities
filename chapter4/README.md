**Check the Largest Number Among Three Inputs in Java.**

This program allows the user to input three numbers and determines the largest among them. If all three numbers are equal, the program prints a specific message indicating equality. The program leverages conditional statements to compare the values and identifies the largest number when applicable.

## Key Skills Covered
- Taking multiple inputs from the user using `Scanner`.
- Using methods for comparing user inputs.
- Comparing integers using conditional statements.
- Implementing equality checks and logical conditions.
- Displaying results based on user input and program logic.

## Task Sheet 1-1-8
**Loop Through and Print Even Numbers Until 237**

This program iterates through a predefined list of numbers, printing all even numbers to the console in the order they appear. The iteration stops as soon as the number 237 is encountered.

## Key Skills Covered
- Iterating through an array using a `for-each` loop.
- Checking if a number is even using the modulus operator (`%`).
- Exiting a loop early using the `break` statement.
- Working with arrays in Java.

## Task Sheet 1-1-9
**Perform Basic Arithmetic Operations with Methods in Java**

This program allows the user to input two numbers and perform the four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Each operation is implemented using a separate method with return types, and the results are printed to the console.

### Key Skills Covered:
- Creating and using methods with return types in Java.
- Handling user input using the `Scanner` class.
- Performing basic arithmetic operations.
- Implementing and handling edge cases, such as division by zero.
