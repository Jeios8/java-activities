## Task Sheet 1-1-5  
**Modify Variables to Resolve Conditional Statements**  

This task involves modifying variable declarations in a Java program so that all conditional `if` statements resolve as `true`. By completing this task, you will improve your understanding of Java string comparison using `==` and `.equals()` and learn how to manipulate variable assignments to satisfy specific conditions. Additionally, you will practice compiling and running Java programs to ensure functionality.  

### Key Skills Covered:
- Understanding Java string comparison (`==` vs `.equals()`).
- Modifying variables to satisfy conditional logic.
- Debugging and testing Java programs to achieve desired outcomes.
- Compiling and running Java programs in an IDE or online environment.

## Task Sheet 1-1-6
**Check if a string is a palindrome using Java.**

This program allows the user to input a string and checks whether the string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward, such as "madam" or "racecar". The program uses `StringBuilder` to reverse the string and the `equals()` method to compare the original string with the reversed version.

## Key Skills Covered
- Using `StringBuilder` for string manipulation.
- Implementing string reversal in Java.
- Comparing strings with the `equals()` method.
- Utilizing user input and performing basic string operations.
